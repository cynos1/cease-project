                        <p>Cigarettes contain nicotine, a chemical that can lead to addiction. Nicotine affects your brain’s dopamine systems in the same way that heroin and cocaine affect an addict’s brain. While smoking, nicotine is quickly absorbed in the body and goes to the brain. It leads to the release of a chemical called dopamine in the brain, which prompts the brain to repeat the smoking behavior. That is why people who smoke find it difficult to quit.

                    <p>Nicotine is a dangerous chemical found in tobacco plants and responsible for tobacco addiction. It is found in tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigars, hookah, smokeless tobacco, and most electronic cigarettes. Nicotine leads to addiction, which puts you at risk of becoming a lifelong smoker, and in turn, causes devastating health problems.</p>

                       <p>Smoking harms almost every organ of the body. Smoking leads to many diseases, including lung diseases, heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes. Smoking can affect bone health and the health of teeth and gum. Women who smoke can find it difficult to become pregnant. Smoking also increases the risk of infectious diseases, certain eye diseases, and the immune system's problems.</p>
                       <li>Environmental effects</li>
						<p>Cigarette smoke impacts our environment also. Cigarettes contain many chemicals that are released from discarded cigarette butts and contaminate soil and waterways. Air contamination occurs through secondhand smoke released into the air, which contains many toxic compounds. Cigarette butts are also toxic to animals. Trees are cut down in order to farm and process tobacco crops. In addition, smoking is one of the leading causes of fire in homes and apartments, causing the loss of property and thousands of lives each year. </p>
						<li>Economic effects</li>
						<p>Smoking cigarettes is expansive. It is important to realize how much money you spend on tobacco. It costs almost $8.00 to buy a pack. From this, you can estimate how much money you spend on cigarettes every day, week, month, and year!

                 <p>Certain activities, moods, places, and situations can spark a strong urge to smoke. These are called triggers. Different people have different triggers. Some of these triggers are associated with food and drink, such as coffee, alcohol, and mealtime. Others are tied to activities such as working, studying, driving, and socializing. Being angry or under stress can trigger cigarette cravings. Even positive feelings of happiness or pleasure can bring up tobacco urges. It is important to know your triggers and be aware of those.

					   <li>Tapering:  involves reducing the number of times you smoke each day. To be successful, smokers should use the smallest number of cigarettes each day until reaching the quit stage.</li>
					   <li>Cold turkey: while not recommended, this method has had limited success for some smokers, usually those who smoke less than 10 cigarettes a day. To go cold turkey means to stop smoking all at once without cessation medications or changes to routines.</li>

NRT reduces withdrawal symptoms by giving a small controlled amount of nicotine without the other dangerous chemicals found in cigarettes. NRT is a proven scientific strategy that can significantly increase your chances of quitting. It’s a safe strategy; NRT won’t lead to addiction and has few or no side effects. You can discontinue NRT medications after 12 weeks of being tobacco-free.</p>

                        <li>If the type of NRT you are taking fails to help you stop smoking, tal with your health care provider about increasing the dosage or ask your provider abiut the option of adding an additional type of NRT or smoking cessation prescription drug.</li>
                        <li><strong>GUM:</strong> Chew gum slowly. Fast chewing may cause nausea and doesn't allow the nicotine to be absorbed properly from the lining of the mouth. Don't drink anything for 15 minutes so your mouth lining has time to absorb the nicotine</li>
						<li><strong>PATCH:</strong> If you are unable to stop smoking a few cigarettes while using the patch, it is best to keep the patch on. Don't allow a few slips to stop you from using the patch. it is possible you may need more than one patch at a time or to add gum or lozenges to help with your cravings. Your health care provider should be consulted about these options.</li>
